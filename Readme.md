### Viewport
The browser's viewport is the area of the window in which web content can be seen. 
This is often not the same size as the rendered page, in which case the browser provides scrollbars for the user to scroll around and access all the content.
When viewport is not set to "device-width",the best is to adopt a responsive design for your site's pages, and set the viewport to match the device's width and scale accordingly.

### CSS
CSS is the language we use to style a Web page which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
